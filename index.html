            Nikola Tesla can be considered as one of the most important
            investors of the 19th and early 20th century. His contribution to
            the invention and development of electromagnetism and
            electrodynamics are outstanding. Tesla contributed by various
            patents to other areas of engineering including telecommunications,
            remote control and mechanic engineering.<br />
            We can credit him for the idea of wireless internet and smartphones.

            Believe it or not, in 1901, Tesla actually had the ideas of a
            wireless way to gather information, code it in his lab, chnage the
            frequency, and broadcast it to a hand-held device nearly exactly how
            our smartphones work today. Like many of Tesla's great ideas, it was
            never created or tested.
